- functions handling Microsoft‚Äôs `JsonDocument` (see [`JsonDocumentUtility`](./Songhay.Modules/JsonDocumentUtility.fs))
- centralizing routines around handling files and directories (see [tests](./Songhay.Modules.Tests/ProgramFileUtilityTests.fs))
- centralizing routines around handling strings (see [tests](./Songhay.Modules.Tests/StringUtilityTests.fs))
